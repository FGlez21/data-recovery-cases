# 💽 Data Recovery Case Collection

This repository contains a personal collection of real-world data recovery cases I've encountered, with a focus on hardware-level diagnostics, visual inspection, and forensic analysis. Some drives were fully or partially recoverable, while others were not — all contributed to my hands-on experience and understanding of failure mechanisms.

## 📂 Case Index

| Case | Failure Type         | Outcome              | Details |

## 🧠 About This Project

Each case is documented with:
- Basic drive information (model, capacity, date)
- Failure symptoms and diagnostic steps
- High-resolution internal photos when available
- Final outcome and technical notes

Cases are organized in individual markdown files within the `cases/` directory. Supporting photos are stored in `evidences/` and referenced accordingly.

This archive serves both as a learning tool and a portfolio of hands-on work in the field of data recovery and digital forensics.
