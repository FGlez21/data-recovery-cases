# ðŸ’½ Data Recovery Case Collection

This repository contains a personal collection of real-world data recovery cases I've encountered, with a focus on hardware-level diagnostics, visual inspection, and forensic analysis. Some drives were fully or partially recoverable, while others were not â€” all contributed to my hands-on experience and understanding of failure mechanisms.
